# AI Agent Rules

## Documentation Priority
- **CRITICAL**: The `README.md` is the single source of truth for library usage and configuration.
- **AI-Readable**: Ensure all code examples in `README.md` are complete, compilable, and up-to-date. AI agents rely on these examples to understand how to use the library.
- **Configuration**: Explicitly document all configuration options (fluent API and appsettings.json) in `README.md`.
